Quick Overview of last session:
Docker engine / containerd
Docker client
docker images 
Docker containers
docker volumes 
docker network 

Software Requirements:
Docker Engine
Docker Compose 
Dive

Starter:
Lets start by pulling a nginx image 

Simple command to run a container
docker run --name training-nginx nginx:1.18-alpine

without Volume mapping
docker run --name training-nginx -d nginx:1.18-alpine

with volume
docker run --name training-nginx -v /some/content:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro -d nginx

Demo:

Documentation: https://docs.docker.com/

Scratch => Debian ==> php:7.2-fpm => lara_image

Multi-Stage Build(New) and builder pattern (Old)
https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/#use-an-external-image-as-a-stage
COPY --from=composer:latest /usr/bin/composer /usr/bin/composer
Pulls composer's official image and only extracts composer from it


.env file - Best practice write once / use everywhere
https://docs.docker.com/compose/env-file/

Docker Compose
https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v2/
Docker Compose file format version should be compatiable with docker engine version

Explain step by step docker compose

Build Image: 
docker-compose build app

This image will build an image named laraapp:latest
Docker Caching will help building images faster through local caching system

Lets expore layers
Dive is system level utility can be used to inspect each layer of the container
dive laraapp:latest

Run all services via docker-compose up -d

docker-compose ps 
will list all the service containers running

Lets execute a command inside the container / useful for alpine based containers that does not come with bash by default
docker-compose exec lara_app ls -l
